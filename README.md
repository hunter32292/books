# Books I'd recommend
- https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319 : Awesome book when you want to learn more about how computers actually work, does an amazing job describing how boolean logic is at the heart of how computers function.

- https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X : Excellent book, take lots of notes when reading. Good stuff that you can use, but broken up into lots of smaller snippets and examples throughout. Great for a book club or on/off reading over time.

- https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Revised-Updated-Saying-dp-1529038340/dp/1529038340 : Every Manager should read this book, and every engineer should read this to understand what their manager has to go through during their day. Creates a lot of empathy for the people problems, which are very difficult.
